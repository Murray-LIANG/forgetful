## Definition

The Spearman correlation coefficient, `rs`, can take values from +1 to -1. A `rs` of +1 indicates a perfect association of ranks, a `rs` of zero indicates no association between ranks and a `rs` of -1 indicates a perfect negative association of ranks. The closer `rs` is to zero, the weaker the association between the ranks.
