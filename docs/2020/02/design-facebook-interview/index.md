# System Design Facebook Interview


## Guideline

1. Should not assume anything.
2. Pin down the requirements, they're looking for me to drive conversation.
3. It should be my design, not half mine and half the interviewers.
4. Try to cover both breadth and depth. Need to talk about both high level concepts and details associated.

## What is Facebook looking for

1. They want to understand how I reason through a problem that I've not necessarily encountered before.
2. They are looking to get signal on both my techincal and communication skills.
3. They expect me to drive the design of my solution and lead the discussion after clarifying the initial problem.
4. Be aware of trade-offs and alternative solutions and express clearly the decisions I make and justify why I made them.
5. Go into a level of technical depth for each element or compoment of my solution.
6. Think about designing at large scale as this is what I will be doing at Facebook.
