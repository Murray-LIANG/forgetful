      <description>Why We Need Pods Docker supports containers, which are great for deploying single units of software. However, this model can become a bit cumbersome when you want to run multiple pieces of software together.

For production systems, many have found that it is instead more useful to deploy those applications in groups of containers that are partially isolated and partially share on environment.</description>
