      <description>Compare Copied from stackoverflow
Redis is fast; really, really fast. It is also immediately consistent, so it&amp;rsquo;s good for fast moving data sets. The downside is that, running on one server, if it fails then you lose write access until another server takes it&amp;rsquo;s place. Replacing the server is a manual operation unless you automate it yourself. (You can still get read access to your data if you configure a slave instance).</description>

      <description>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37293928/zookeeper-vs-in-memory-data-grid-vs-redis By default, Zookeeper replicates all your data to every node and lets clients watch the data for changes. Changes are sent very quickly (within a bounded amount of time) to clients. You can also create &amp;ldquo;ephemeral nodes&amp;rdquo;, which are deleted within a specified time if a client disconnects. ZooKeeper is highly optimized for reads, while writes are very slow (since they generally are sent to every client as soon as the write takes place).</description>
