      <description>Guideline  Should not assume anything. Pin down the requirements, they&amp;rsquo;re looking for me to drive conversation. It should be my design, not half mine and half the interviewers. Try to cover both breadth and depth. Need to talk about both high level concepts and details associated.  What is Facebook looking for  They want to understand how I reason through a problem that I&amp;rsquo;ve not necessarily encountered before. They are looking to get signal on both my techincal and communication skills.</description>
