Distributed Lock  Could use etcd as backend. Some implementation: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/clientv3/concurrency/mutex.go  If two clients request to lock at the same time, the later client would change the value of same key in etcd3 but with new revision. The lock logic needs to wait for old revision deletion which means the older lock is released. To make sure locks released even when clients crash, use expiration on the key.</description>
