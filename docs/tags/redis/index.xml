      <description>etcd is a highly available key-value store.
redis, memcached are popular key-value stores. These are general-purpose distributed memory caching system often used to speed up dynamic database-driven websites by caching data and objects in memory.
etcd cannot be stored in memory, they can only be persisted in disk storage, whereas redis can be cached in ram and can also be persisted in disk.
etcd does not have various data types. But redis and other key-value stores have data-type flexibility.</description>

      <description>Data structures  Binary-safe strings Lists Sets Sorted sets Hashes Bit arrays (bitmaps) HyperLogLogs  LRU cache Used as a caching system.
Master slave replication  async replication is used.  Persistence Several options:
 RDB: Redis Database Backup, hot snapshot that is taken periodically and is meant for point-in-time recovery. An RDB file is literally a dump of all user data stored in an internal, compressed serialization format. AOF: Append Only File, persist the dataset by taking a snapshot and appending it with changes as they arrive.</description>

      <description>Compare Copied from stackoverflow
Redis is fast; really, really fast. It is also immediately consistent, so it&amp;rsquo;s good for fast moving data sets. The downside is that, running on one server, if it fails then you lose write access until another server takes it&amp;rsquo;s place. Replacing the server is a manual operation unless you automate it yourself. (You can still get read access to your data if you configure a slave instance).</description>
